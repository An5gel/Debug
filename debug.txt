DEBUGGING
Debugging is the process and finding and solving errors in code.

A BUG
A bug is a gliche in software, an error in code that prevents it
 to perform from the way its intended to

TYPES OF BUGS
-syntax errors:
    These occur when code does not follow the syntactical rules.
    eg"<div classhome><div>,mistyping etc
-logic/logical errors:
    These occur when the stepstaken to perform the task correctly 
    are not well done eg an infinite loop
-design errors:
     That is a bug that is carried from the designers to the actual
     implementation of the code
     these are bugs caused by poor or inadequate design decisions.
     eg bad/poor user interface,wrong data TYPES
-runtime errors:
    these occur during the execution of the code.they cant be noticed 
    until the code is run eg calling a value that doesnt exist, deviding
     a number by zero,adding a string to an integer
    
 WHY DEBUG?
-To removs errors in code
-To save resources; time and money
-To improve productivity and effiency of the developer

HOW TO DEBUG
Prior
Planning
Prevents
poor
performance

DEBUGGING PRINCIPLES
=>Bugs caught early are the  easiest to fix because the details are fresh 
in your mind and you know exactly where to look
=>once bugs escape the become very hard to find due to a larger
code base to search.you may also not have the details of the code

DEBUGGING CYCLE
STEP1; Codding(Writting your code)
STEP2; Testing(checking functionality)
STEP3; If the code is working as intended,proceed to develop code
STEP4; If the code isnt working then go on to Debugging
STEP5; Then repeat cycle as they all go

A BUG SEEKING CYCLE
Difference between debugging and Testing
debugging is what you do to fix code with error while testing is 
what you do to break the code

STEPS OF DEBUGGING
1.Plan your attack
2.Backup your files ie using version control or git hub to keep 
truck of changes 
3.Isolate the errored code/modules ie commenting it out
4.Finding the error code/ACTUAL LINE OF CODE WITH error
5.fix the error dont patch it/dont try to just make it work
6. test the fix
7.look for similar bugs
